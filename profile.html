        <!--description-->

        <p id="descri">Mikasa Ackerman (ミカサ・アッカーマン Mikasa Akkāman?) is one of the two deuteragonists of the series,
            along with Armin Arlert.

            After her parents were murdered by human traffickers, Mikasa was rescued by Eren Yeager and lived with him
            and his parents, Grisha and Carla, before the fall of Wall Maria. She is the last descendant of the Shogun
            clan that stayed on Paradis Island, thereby related to the Azumabito family, and holds significant political
            power in Hizuru. <br>

            Though she desires only to live a peaceful life, Mikasa entered into the military—where she is considered
            the best soldier among the 104th Training Corps. She later enlists in the Survey Corps to follow and protect
            Eren, becoming one of its greatest assets. She is currently serving as an officer (上官 Jōkan?) in the Corps.
            <br>


            Mikasa is a fairly tall and well-toned woman. She is of partial Asian heritage, with pale skin, gray eyes,
            and shaggy black hair that was long until she cut it to chin-length. By the year 854, her hair is shorter
            and cut up to the back of her neck, though she simultaneously wears noticeably longer bangs. She bears a
            tattoo of the Azumabito family crest on the outside of her right wrist. There is a small scar below her
            right eye, which was due to an injury delivered by Eren's Titan during the Battle of Trost District.</p>
        <p>
            Mikasa cares deeply for her friends and caretakers, seeing them as the last remnants of a family she cannot
            afford to lose. She also appears to have a soft spot for children, evidenced by her bowing to a young girl
            she saved and her instantly saving a Marleyan soldier, despite the latter having earlier killed one of her
            comrades. Mikasa is not completely immune to the effects of her emotions, however: Her strong feelings for
            her beloved ones, particularly when they are in harm's way, does at times cloud her judgment in
            fury—sometimes to the endangerment of herself and others. A notable example was when Mikasa briefly gave
            in to her grief over Eren's apparent demise and lost the will to live, forgetting her responsibility for the
            lives of the soldiers she took upon herself to lead in the process. However, she was reawakened by her
            memories of Eren and a made decision to never give up again, as her memories would die with her.</p>

        <p>From an early age, Mikasa was unusually perceptive, aware of the harshness of nature by witnessing the manner in
        which predators hunt and kill weaker prey.</p> 

        <p> Her peace was shattered when a band of criminals brutally murdered her parents before her eyes in a failed
            kidnapping attempt, only saving herself and her rescuer when she managed to abandon all inhibition and
            hesitation to kill one of her assailants. Following this traumatic event, Mikasa would gain a generally
            cynical outlook on life and accept the world as a cruel place where only those who are strong are able to
            survive. Her determination to protect her beloved ones as much as possible has contributed greatly to
            her phenomenal skills as a soldier. Though being among the best of the best, she remains humble and refrains
            from putting on airs or displaying arrogance.

            Mikasa has a strong sense of right and wrong, doing everything she can to make her most impulsive friends
            follow what she thinks is the right track. In spite of this, she is well aware that she cannot always sway
            them in decisions and makes it a point to follow them wherever they go, just so that she can be around to
            help out when trouble arises.[23] The sole reason she enlisted in the military and joined the Survey Corps
            after her graduation was to keep an eye on Eren, despite the fact that she truly wished to live out the rest
            of her days in relative peace within the Walls alongside him.</p>

        <p> Mikasa's bond with Eren is undoubtedly her most important relationship and the one that defines her. Her
        personality as a teenager was very much influenced by Eren, who told her she stood no chance of survival if she
        did not fight for it.[24] His words continued to stay with her, and she automatically recalled them to spur her
        on when she was close to death. Mikasa wears the black scarf Eren gave her when they first met, holding on to it
        as a source of strength and comfort when she is upset.She had openly wept tears of relief at his safety and
        developed vengeful grudges towards those who harm him, from enemies to her own superiors. She blushed when it
        was insinuated she and Eren were lovers;[26] furthermore, after he insulted her and stated that he had always
        hated her, she was visibly hurt and eventually left behind the scarf he had given her.
